ExplanationMessage.usedSecLineDrugs     = Second-line drugs received previously is an auto calculated field. The system considers the information on Previous TB Treatments to check what is the answer for this field. Check the rule:<br/>YES: If at least one substance in all Previous TB Treatments is second line.<br/>UNKNOWN: If only exists Previous TB treatment registered with no substances selected<br/>NO: If there is only first line drugs selected or if there is no Previous TB Treatments registered.
ExplanationMessage.treatmentCategory    = Treatment Category is an auto calculated field. The system considers the information on the first Treatment Registered (disconsidering any change) and the information on Registration group field to check what is the answer for this field. Check the rule:<br/>Initial regimen with first-line drugs: When the case is on the NEW or Treatment History Unknown registration group and doesn't have second line drugs on the treatment.<br/>Retreatment regimen with first-line drugs: When the case is in any other registration group than NEW or Treatment History Unknown and doesn't have second line drugs on the treatment.<br/>Second-line treatment regimen: When the case has at least one second line drug in its treatment.
ExplanationMessage.caseDefinition       = Case Definition is an auto calculated field. The system considers the information on the microscopy, xpert and culture exams to check what is the answer for this field. This field is only calculated to confirmed cases. Check the rule:<br/>The system will select the last exam of each type before the start treatment date, or the last exam registered for cases without treatment registered.<br/>Bacteriologically Confirmed: when at least one of the exams selected is positive.<br/>Clinically Diagnosed: if the case is confirmed but there is no exam registered or all of the exams selected are negative.
